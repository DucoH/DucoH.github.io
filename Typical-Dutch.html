      <h2>Typical Dutch</h2>
       <h3>Typical Dutch Food</h3>
        <p>Some typical Dutch sweets are: gevulde koeken, stroopwafels, jodenkoeken and last but definetly not least stroopwafels. Stroopwafels are really nice, it's a wafle with syrup inside and it's really good. We also have typical dinner like hutspot (cooked potato with carrot), boerenkool and andijvie. In the Netherlands we have some traditional fishes like haring (hollands haring happen) and lekkerbekjes.</p>

      <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>The most played sport in Holland is football, we have really great players like Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Memphis Depay. We also got a lot of great Judo players like Pieter van de Hogeband. There's a great female hockey team, they've won a lot of prices.</p>

      <h3>Holiday's</h3>
        <p>We got a lot of fun holiday's, like Konigsdag. With Koningsdag everyone is dressed in orange, drinking beer and partying. We also got a childrens holiday named Sinterklaas. Sinterklaas is a white man with his black helpers (zwarte pieten). Because it's one white man who orders his black helpers a lot of people think that it's racist and other people think it's just a tradition and innocent. That discussion has been around for a while now and is still not over. In a specific area in the Netherlands, called Brabant, there's a holiday where everyone puts on costumes and drink beers all day.</p>
